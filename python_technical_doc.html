      <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language
        that was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s.
        It is named after the Monty Python comedy group and has
        become one of the most popular programming languages in
        the world.<br><br> Python is known for its simple, easy-to-read
        syntax and its versatility, as it can be used for a wide
        variety of applications, including web development,
        data analysis, and machine learning. Additionally,
        Python has a large and active community of developers,
        as well as many third-party libraries and tools available.
        With its automatic memory management and support for
        object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes
        and inheritance, Python is a great language for both
        beginners and experienced programmers alike.</p>

      <header>Sintax</header>
      <p>Python is known for its simple, easy-to-read syntax, which makes
        it a great language for beginners to learn. Python code is written
        using indentation to denote blocks of code, rather than using braces
        or semicolons like many other programming languages. Variables in
        Python don't need to be declared before use, and data types are
        dynamically determined based on the value assigned to them.
        Python also supports many built-in data types and operations,
        including strings, lists, dictionaries, and mathematical
        operations. With its straightforward syntax and built-in
        functionality, Python is a great language for a wide range
        of applications, from simple scripts to complex web applications
        and data analysis projects.</p>
      <h4>Example of relevant Sintax</h4>
      <pre>
      <code class="language-python"># This is a comment in Python
# Variables don't need to be declared before use
message = "Hello, world!"

# The print() function displays output to the console
print(message)

# Python uses indentation to denote blocks of code
if len(message) > 10:
    print("The message is long")
else:
    print("The message is short")

# Python supports many built-in data types and operations
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Loops and conditionals are also fundamental to Python
for num in my_list:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{num} is even")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is odd")
        </code>
        </pre>

      <p><span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span>
        This code snippet demonstrates several features of Python syntax,
        including comments, variables, print statements, indentation to
        denote blocks of code, conditionals, loops, lists, and dictionaries.

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Control_Flow_tools">
      <header>Control Flow Tools</header>
      <p>Control flow tools in Python are used to dictate the order in which a 
        program's instructions are executed. One such tool is the "if" statement,
        which allows a program to execute certain code only if a specified condition
        is met. For example, if a user enters an incorrect password, an "if" statement
        can be used to display an error message and prompt the user to try again.
        Another important control flow tool is the "for" loop, which allows a 
        program to repeatedly execute a block of code for each item in a sequence.
        This is particularly useful when working with lists, tuples, and other data structures.
      </p>
       <p> In addition to "if" statements and "for" loops, Python also includes other control flow tools
        such as "while" loops, "try" and "except" statements, and "break" and "continue" statements.
        Each of these tools serves a specific purpose and can be used to build more complex programs
        with greater functionality. Understanding how to use these control flow tools effectively is
        essential for any Python programmer who wants to create efficient, reliable, and maintainable code.</p>
      <h4>Example 1: Using an if statement</h4>
      <pre>
      <code class="language-python">number = 10
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("The number is even")
else:
    print("The number is odd")
        </code>
        </pre>
      <p><span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span>
        In this code, an "if" statement is used to check whether the number variable is even or odd.
        The modulo operator (%) is used to determine whether the number is divisible by 2 with no remainder.
        If it is, then the number is even and the program prints "The number is even". If not, the number is odd
        and the program prints "The number is odd".
      </p>
      <h4>Example 2: Using a "for" loop to iterate over a list</h4>
      <pre>
      <code class="language-python">names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]

for name in names:
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
        </code>
        </pre>

      <p><span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span>
        In this code, a "for" loop is used to iterate over each item in the names list.
        For each name in the list, the program prints a greeting that includes the name.
        This is a simple example of how "for" loops can be used to perform a repetitive
        task for each item in a sequence.
      </p>

      <h4>Example 3: Using a while loop together with try and catch</h4>
      <pre>
      <code class="language-python">valid_input = False

while not valid_input:
    age_str = input("Please enter your age: ")
    try:
        age = int(age_str)
        valid_input = True
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input, please enter a valid integer")

print("Your age is " + str(age))
        </code>
        </pre>
      <p><span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span>
        In this code, a "while" loop is used to keep prompting the user for their age
        until valid input is entered. The input() function is used to get input from
        the user, and a "try" and "except" block is used to handle any errors that
        may occur when converting the input to an integer. Once valid input is entered,
        the program prints the user's age.
      </p>

      <h4>Example 4: Using a break statement to exit a loop early</h4>
      <pre>
      <code class="language-python">numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 
for number in numbers:
    if number == 3:
        break
    print(number)

print("Loop finished")
        </code>
        </pre>
      <p><span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span>
        In this code, a "for" loop is used to iterate over a list of numbers.
        When the loop encounters the number 3, a "break" statement is used
        to exit the loop early. This means that the program only prints the
        numbers 1 and 2, and then prints "Loop finished". This is an example
        of how "break" statements can be used to exit a loop early if a certain condition is met.
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Working_with_Data">
      <header>Working with Data</header>
      <p>Python is a powerful language for working with data, whether you're
        reading data from files, querying databases, or manipulating data in
        memory. Python has built-in support for many data formats, including
        CSV, JSON, and XML, and third-party libraries are available for
        working with other formats such as Excel spreadsheets and SQL
        databases.<br><br> Python also has a rich set of libraries for data
        manipulation and analysis, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
        With these tools, you can easily read, transform, and visualize
        data, making Python an excellent choice for data analysis and
        scientific computing.</p>
      <h4>Example using pandas</h4>
      <pre>
      <code class="language-python">import pandas as pd

# Read a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Filter the DataFrame to only include rows where the 'age' column is greater than 30
df_filtered = df[df['age'] > 30]

# Group the DataFrame by the 'gender' column and calculate the average age for each group
df_grouped = df_filtered.groupby('gender').mean()

# Create a bar chart of the average ages by gender using Matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.bar(df_grouped.index, df_grouped['age'])
plt.xlabel('Gender')
plt.ylabel('Average Age')
plt.show()

      </code>
      </pre>
      <p><span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span>
        This code snippet demonstrates several features of working with data in
        Python, including reading data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame,
        filtering and grouping the data, and creating a visualization of the
        results using Matplotlib.
      </p>
    </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Working_with_Files">
        <header>Working with Files</header>
        <p>Working with files is a common task in many programming projects, and
          Python provides a variety of built-in functions and modules for working
          with files. With Python, you can easily read and write text files,
          binary files, and more. The built-in open() function can be used
          to open a file and read its contents or write new data to it.
          Python also provides modules for working with specific file
          formats, such as CSV, JSON, and XML files. With these tools,
          you can easily read and write data to and from files, making
          it easy to integrate file I/O into your Python programs.</p>
        <h4>Example of reading and writing in files</h4>
        <pre>
        <code class="language-python"># Open a file for reading
with open('data.txt', 'r') as f:
    # Read the entire contents of the file
    contents = f.read()
    # Print the contents of the file
    print(contents)

# Open a file for writing
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    # Write some data to the file
    f.write('Hello, world!')
        </code>
        </pre>
        <p><span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span>
          This code snippet demonstrates how to use Python's built-in file I/O
          functions to read and write files. In the first block, the open()
          function is used to open a file in read-only mode, and the read()
          method is used to read the entire contents of the file into a string.
          In the second block, the open() function is used to open a file in
          write mode, and the write() method is used to write the string "Hello, world!"
          to the file. Note that both blocks use the with statement to ensure that the
          file is closed automatically when the block is exited, even if an exception is raised.

    <section class="main-section" id="Object_Oriented_Programming">
      <header>Object Oriented Programming</header>
      <p>Assuming you know the basics of object-oriented programming, this section will
        be explained with three examples.</p>
      <h4>Example 1: Creating a class</h4>
        <pre>
      <code class="language-python"># Define a class for a person
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I'm {self.age} years old.")

# Create a new person object and call its greet method
person = Person('Alice', 30)
person.greet()

      </code>
      </pre>
      <p><span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span>
        In this example, we define a simple Person class with a constructor method that sets the person's
        name and age, and a greet method that prints a message to introduce the person. We then create a
        new Person object with the name "Alice" and age 30, and call its greet method to print a greeting.
      </p>
      <h4>Example 2: Inheritance</h4>
      <pre>
      <code class="language-python"># Define a base class for animals
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        pass

# Define a subclass for dogs
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says woof!")

# Define a subclass for cats
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says meow!")

# Create some animal objects and call their speak methods
dog = Dog('Fido')
cat = Cat('Fluffy')
dog.speak()
cat.speak()
      </code>
    </pre>

      <p> <span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span>In this example, we define a base Animal class with an empty speak method, and two subclasses Dog and Cat that
        override the speak method to print a different message for each type of animal. We then create a Dog object
        named "Fido" and a Cat object named "Fluffy", and call their speak methods to hear them "speak".</p>

      <h4> Example 3: Polymorphism</h4>
      <pre>
      <code class="language-python"># Define a base class for shapes
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

# Define a subclass for rectangles
class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

# Define a subclass for circles
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

# Create some shape objects and call their area methods
rectangle = Rectangle(5, 10)
circle = Circle(7)
print(f"The area of the rectangle is {rectangle.area()}.")
print(f"The area of the circle is {circle.area()}.")
      </code>
    </pre>

      <p> <span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span>In this example, we define a base Shape class with an empty area method, and two subclasses Rectangle
        and Circle that override the area method to compute the area of a rectangle or circle. We then create
        a Rectangle object with width 5 and height 10, and a Circle object with radius 7, and call their area
        methods to compute their areas. The key concept here is that we can treat these different shapes as
        instances of a common base class, and call the same area method on each of them to get their areas.
        This is an example of polymorphism, where different objects can be treated as if they have the same
        interface.

      <header>Libraries and Modules</header>
      <p>Libraries and modules are pre-written code that you can use in your Python programs to perform specific tasks.
        A module is a single file that contains Python definitions and statements, while a library is a collection of
        related modules that can be imported into your program to provide additional functionality.<br><br>

        Python has a large standard library that comes included with the language, providing modules for tasks such as
        file I/O,
        networking, and regular expressions. There are also many third-party libraries available for Python, such as
        NumPy for
        scientific computing, Pandas for data analysis, and Django for web development.<br><br>

        To use a module or library in your program, you need to first import it using the import statement. Once
        imported, you
        can access the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module or library and use them in your program.
      </p>

      
      <h4>Example using math module: </h4>
      <pre>
      <code class="language-python">import math

x = math.sqrt(25)
print(x)  # Output: 5.0

      </code>
    </pre>

      <p><span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span> In this example, we import the math module and use its sqrt function to compute the square root of
        25.
        We then print the result, which should be 5.0.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Debugging_and_Troubleshooting">
      <header>Debugging and Troubleshooting</header>
      <p>Debugging and troubleshooting are critical skills for any programmer, and Python provides several tools to help
        you
        find and fix bugs in your code. Here's a brief explanation of these tools:</p>
      <ol>
        <li class="numbered">The print() function:
          <p style="font-weight: normal;"> One of the simplest and most effective debugging techniques is to use the print()
            function
            to output the values of variables or expressions at different points in your code. This can help you
            identify
            where a problem is occurring and what values are causing it.
          </p>
        
        </li>
        <li class="numbered">The pdb module:
          <p style="font-weight: normal;">
            Python also includes a built-in debugger called pdb, which allows you to step through your
            code
            line by line, set breakpoints, and inspect variables and their values. You can launch the debugger by
            inserting
            the line import pdb; pdb.set_trace() at the point in your code where you want to start debugging.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="numbered">IDEs and editors:
          <p style="font-weight: normal;">
            Many Python IDEs and editors, such as PyCharm and Visual Studio Code, include built-in
            debugging
            tools that provide a graphical interface for setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting
            variables.
            These tools can make the debugging process faster and more efficient.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li class="numbered"> Stack traces and error messages:
          <p style="font-weight: normal;">
             When your program encounters an error, Python will typically provide a
            stack trace
            and an error message that can help you identify the source of the problem. It's important to read these
            messages
            carefully and understand what they are telling you, as they can often provide valuable clues about where to
            look for the bug.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><span class="numbered">
        By using these tools and techniques, you can become a more effective debugger and troubleshooter, and improve
        the quality
        and reliability of your Python programs.</span>
      </p>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Web_Development">
      <header>Web Development</header>
      <p>Web development in Python is typically done using web frameworks such as Django or Flask. These frameworks
        provide a set
        of tools and libraries for building web applications, including handling HTTP requests and responses, managing
        sessions
        and user authentication, and interfacing with databases.<br><br>

        Django is a full-featured web framework that includes many built-in components, such as an ORM for database
        access, an admin
        interface for managing data, and a templating engine for generating HTML pages. Flask, on the other hand, is a
        lightweight
        framework that provides just the basic tools needed for building web applications, making it more flexible and
        customizable.<br><br>

        In addition to the web frameworks themselves, Python also has many libraries for working with web-related
        technologies
        such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For example, the BeautifulSoup library can be used to parse HTML and extract
        data,
        while requests can be used to make HTTP requests to external APIs.<br><br>

        Overall, Python is a powerful and versatile language for web development, and its many libraries and frameworks
        make it
        a great choice for building everything from small personal websites to large-scale enterprise applications.
      </p>

      <h4>Example using Flask</h4>
      <pre>
      <code class="language-python">from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return render_template('about.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

      </code>
    </pre>
      <span>
      <p><span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span>
        In this example, we define a Flask application and two routes: one for the homepage
        ("/") and one for an "about" page ("/about"). The hello() function returns a simple
        greeting, while the about() function uses a template to generate an HTML page.

        To run the application, we check if the script is being run as the main program and call the
        run() function. With debug=True, Flask will automatically reload the application whenever
        changes are made, making it easy to iterate and test during development.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Testing">
      <header>Testing</header>
      <p>Testing is a crucial part of software development, as it helps ensure that your code works as
        expected and catches any potential bugs or errors before they reach your users. In Python,
        there are several testing frameworks available, including unittest, pytest, and doctest.<br><br>

        The unittest module is included in Python's standard library and provides a set of tools
        for writing and running unit tests. pytest is a popular third-party testing framework
        that offers more advanced features and is known for its simplicity and ease of use.
        doctest is another built-in module that allows you to include tests directly in your
        documentation strings, making it easy to ensure that your code examples stay up-to-date and accurate.<br><br>

        To use a testing framework, you typically write a set of test functions that exercise
        different parts of your code and assert that the results are correct. For example,
        you might write a test function that checks that a certain calculation returns the
        expected value, or that a function raises an exception when given invalid input.</p>
      <h4>Example using pytest</h4>
      <pre>
      <code class="language-python">def test_addition():
assert 2 + 2 == 4
      </code>
    </pre>
      <p><span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span>
        In this example, we define a test function called test_addition() that asserts that 2 + 2 equals 4.
        If the assertion is true, the test passes. If the assertion is false, the test fails and an error message is
        displayed.

        To run this test function using pytest, we simply save the code above in a file called test_example.
        py and run pytest from the command line:
      </p>

      <pre>
      <code class="language-python">
$ pytest test_example.py
      </code>
    </pre>

      <p><span class="numbered"><b>Explanation: </b></span> will run all the test functions defined in test_example.py and report the results.
        In this case, we should see a message indicating that the test_addition() function passed.
      </p>
